\title{Forecast a linear model with possible time series components}
\format{
An object of class \code{forecast} is a list usually containing at least
the following elements:
\describe{
\item{model}{A list containing information about the fitted model}
\item{method}{The name of the forecasting method as a character string}
\item{mean}{Point forecasts as a time series}
\item{lower}{Lower limits for prediction intervals}
\item{upper}{Upper limits for prediction intervals}
\item{level}{The confidence values associated with the prediction intervals}
\item{x}{The original time series.}
\item{residuals}{Residuals from the fitted model. For models with additive
errors, the residuals will be x minus the fitted values.}
\item{fitted}{Fitted values (one-step forecasts)}
}
The function \code{summary} can be used to obtain and print a summary of the
results, while the functions \code{plot} and \code{autoplot} produce plots of the forecasts and
prediction intervals. The generic accessors functions \code{fitted.values} and \code{residuals}
extract various useful features from the underlying model.

\usage{
\method{forecast}{lm}(
  object,
  newdata,
  h = 10,
  level = c(80, 95),
  fan = FALSE,
  lambda = object$lambda,
  biasadj = NULL,
  ts = TRUE,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{Object of class "lm", usually the result of a call to
\code{\link[stats:lm]{stats::lm()}} or \code{\link[=tslm]{tslm()}}.}

\item{newdata}{An optional data frame in which to look for variables with
which to predict. If omitted, it is assumed that the only variables are
trend and season, and \code{h} forecasts are produced.}

\item{h}{Number of periods for forecasting. Ignored if \code{newdata}
present.}

\item{level}{Confidence levels for prediction intervals.}

\item{fan}{If \code{TRUE}, \code{level} is set to \code{seq(51, 99, by = 3)}.
This is suitable for fan plots.}

\item{lambda}{Box-Cox transformation parameter. If \code{lambda = "auto"},
then a transformation is automatically selected using \code{BoxCox.lambda}.
The transformation is ignored if NULL. Otherwise,
data transformed before model is estimated.}

\item{biasadj}{Use adjusted back-transformed mean for Box-Cox
transformations. If transformed data is used to produce forecasts and fitted
values, a regular back transformation will result in median forecasts. If
biasadj is \code{TRUE}, an adjustment will be made to produce mean forecasts
and fitted values.}

\item{ts}{If \code{TRUE}, the forecasts will be treated as time series
provided the original data is a time series; the \code{newdata} will be
interpreted as related to the subsequent time periods. If \code{FALSE}, any
time series attributes of the original data will be ignored.}

\item{...}{Other arguments passed to \code{\link[stats:predict.lm]{stats::predict.lm()}}.}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{forecast}.
}
\description{
\code{forecast.lm} is used to predict linear models, especially those
involving trend and seasonality components.
}
\details{
\code{forecast.lm} is largely a wrapper for
\code{\link[stats:predict.lm]{stats::predict.lm()}} except that it allows variables "trend"
and "season" which are created on the fly from the time series
characteristics of the data. Also, the output is reformatted into a
\code{forecast} object.
}
\examples{

y <- ts(rnorm(120, 0, 3) + 1:120 + 20 * sin(2 * pi * (1:120) / 12), frequency = 12)
fit <- tslm(y ~ trend + season)
plot(forecast(fit, h = 20))
